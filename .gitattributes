# Set default behavior for all text files across platforms.
# This means Git will try to automatically detect if a file is text or binary.
# If it's text, it will convert line endings based on the platform's standard
# during checkout (CRLF on Windows, LF on macOS/Linux) and convert to LF on commit.
* text=auto

# Explicitly define handling for .cmd files.
# This ensures that .cmd files (Windows batch scripts) are treated as text,
# and their canonical form in the repository is LF (Line Feed).
# When checked out on a Windows system, Git will convert them to CRLF.
# On macOS, they will remain LF, which is consistent with the system.
